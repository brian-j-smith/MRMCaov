## Description

**MRMCaov** is an R package for statistical comparison of diagnostic tests - such as those based on medical imaging - for which ratings have been obtained from multiple readers and on multiple cases.  Features of the package include the following.

* Performance metrics: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (empirical/trapezoidal and proper parametric curves)
* Study designs: factorial, cases nested within readers, cases nested within tests, partially-paired cases
* Covariance estimation methods: DeLong, jackknife, unbiased
