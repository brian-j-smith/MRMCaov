Description: Statistical tools for estimating and comparing the performances of
    diagnostic tests in multi-reader multi-case studies where true case
    statuses (or ground truths) are known and one or more readers provide
    test ratings for multiple cases.  Reader performance metrics are provided
    for area under and expected utility of ROC curves, likelihood ratio of
    positive or negative tests, and sensitivity and specificity.  ROC curves can
    be estimated empirically or with binormal or binormal likelihood-ratio
    models.  Statistical comparisons of diagnostic tests are based on the
    ANOVA model of Obuchowski-Rockette and the unified framework of Hillis.  The
    ANOVA can be conducted with data from a full factorial, nested, or partially
    paired study design; with random or fixed readers or cases; and covariances
    estimated with the DeLong method, jackknifing, or an unbiased method.
